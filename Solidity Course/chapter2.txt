1. 2 data types=> address and mapping 

2. Each account has an address, which you can think of like a bank account number. It's a unique identifier that points to that account

3. Mappings are another way of storing organized data in Solidity just like arrays and structs. A mapping is essentially a key-value store for storing and looking up data

4. Note: In Solidity, function execution always needs to start with an external caller. A contract will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions. So there will always be a msg.sender.

5.  Solidity doesn't have native string comparison, so we compare their keccak256 hashes to see if the strings are equal

6. Storage vs Memory 
In Solidity, there are two locations you can store variables â€” in storage and in memory.

7. For our contract to talk to another contract on the blockchain that we don't own, first we need to define an interface.

8. keccak256 is used for generating random number in Solidity
