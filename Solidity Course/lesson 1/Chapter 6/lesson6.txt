1. WEB3
call is used for view and pure functions. It only runs on the local node, and won't create a transaction on the blockchain.
    Using Web3.js, you would call a function named myMethod with the parameter 123 as follows:
    myContract.methods.myMethod(123).call()

2. SEND 
send will create a transaction and change data on the blockchain. You'll need to use send for any functions that aren't view or pure.
