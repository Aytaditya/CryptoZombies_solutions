advance solidity concepts

1. HOW TO SAVE GAS: 
   If you have multiple uints inside a struct, using a smaller-sized uint when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage 
   struct NormalStruct {
    uint a;
    uint b;
    uint c;
  }
  struct MiniMe {
    uint32 a;
    uint32 b;
    uint c;
  }    miniMe will save the gas 

  cluster identical data types together (i.e. put them next to each other in the struct) so that Solidity can minimize the required storage space. For example, a struct with fields uint c; uint32 a; uint32 b; will cost less gas than a struct with fields uint32 a; uint c; uint32 b; because the uint32 fields are clustered together.
