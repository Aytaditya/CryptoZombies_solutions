How blockchain functions?
You write a message (call a function).
A manager collects it with other messages (transactions).
The manager solves a hard puzzle (Proof of Work).
The solution and messages are posted (block is published).
Other managers verify it.
Everyone moves on to the next set of messages and puzzle.
This way, everyone can trust the messages on the board because they know they've been verified and agreed upon by the network of managers.
