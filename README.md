<h1>Curious to Know How Ethereum Works?</h1>

Imagine Ethereum as a big, global bulletin board where people can post messages. But before your message gets posted, it has to go through a few steps to make sure it's valid and everyone agrees on it.

## Posting a Message (Calling a Function on a Contract)
You want to post a message on this global bulletin board. To do this, you write your message and give it to one of the board's managers (a node).

## Collecting Messages (Transactions)
The manager collects your message along with many others from different people who also want to post messages.

## Solving a Puzzle (Proof of Work)
Before posting these messages, the manager must solve a really hard puzzle. This puzzle requires a lot of guessing and checking. The first manager to solve the puzzle gets to post the collected messages on the board.

## Posting the Messages (Publishing a Block)
Once the puzzle is solved, the manager attaches the solution (Proof of Work) to the list of messages and tries to post it on the board for everyone to see.

## Checking the Solution (Verification by Other Nodes)
Other managers stop trying to solve the puzzle and check the solution. They make sure the messages are valid and the puzzle was solved correctly.

## Moving to the Next Puzzle
If everything checks out, the messages are officially posted, and all managers move on to collecting new messages and trying to solve the next puzzle.
